I've always been a fan of retro, arcade and retro arcade games, mostly because their limitations often  resulted in very creative game mechanics that were easy to learn and difficult to master. Mark Brown from [Game Maker's Toolkit][youtube-game-makers-toolkit] has done [an excellent video][youtube-game-makers-toolkit] about "versatile verbs", in a number of excellent games, which I recommend you to watch. Older games were less versatile, but as they were written mostly for _arcade machines_, which usually had a very limited set of inputs, those games utilise the few buttons they had in various ways.

> 🎮 In this series I'll show you all the steps to build a Tetris clone, abiding by the [Tetris Guideline][wiki-tetris-guideline], the current specification that [The Tetris Company][wiki-tetris-company] enforces for making all new (2001 and later) _Tetris_ game products alike in form.

Even if you provide a clone for free, you could still get a cease and desist. [This reddit thread][reddit-tetris] is pretty comprehensive how to go about this. Additionally, [this Ars Technica article][article-law-tetris-clone] talks in-depth about how courts judge gaming clones using _Tetris_ and the alledged clone _Mino_ as an example.

In this first article, we'll be looking at the **domain** of the game, meaning which **nouns** (object/subjects) and **verbs** (actions/functions) exist in the game.

## Definitions and Concepts

First, let's look at al the game definitions and concepts, before writing any code. I generally do this step of domain modelling before I write any code, because it will probably help out making the right abstractions.

### Movement and Buttons

In the classic Tetris, as released in 1984, the number of inputs was basically the same as the version developed for the iPod (Tetris 2006):

- a button to move the falling _Tetromino_ left
- a button to move the falling _Tetromino_ right
- a button to drop-and-lock the falling _Tetromino_
- a button to rotate the _Tetromino_.

The standard button mapping adds a few more:

- a button to drop (but not lock) the falling _Tetromino_
- a button to rotate the _Tetromino_ in the other direction (so counter-clockwise vs clockwise)
- a button to use hold

Whilst these actions seem pretty simple by themselves, together with the other game rules, they can act on a wide vocalbulary.

Binding a specific _verb_ to a button is what we call a **mapping**. The mapping has standards as defined by the [Tetris Guideline][wiki-tetris-guideline].

### Playfield

In the manual for _Tetris for NES_ (1989) the **playfield** is defined as:

> PLAYFIELD: This is where the action is.

It makes up the grid on which the _tetriminos_ fall and come to rest. In the majority of the games the width is 10 tiles, and the height ranges from 16 through 24 tiles. Aboe the grid, there are 20 rows "hidden", which is called the _Vanish Zone_.

### Tetrominos

There are various _Tetrominos_: shapes that come dropping down from the top of the playfield. They are defined as follows:

- Cyan: _I_
- Yellow: _O_
- Purple: _T_
- Green: _S_
- Red: _Z_
- Blue: _J_
- Orange _L_

![The different variations of Tetrominos](../../images/articles/tetris/001-introduction/variations.png "All the Tetrominos")

They also have defined _starting locations_:

- Middle: _I_ and _O_
- Left-Middle: everything else

They should all spawn _horizontally_, with _J_, _L_ and _T_ spawning the flat-side first, and spawn above the visible playfied (inside the _Vanish Zone_), but drop one space if there is nothing in its path (becoming visible).

### Generator

There is a [Random Generator][wiki-tetris-guideline-random] to generate the pieces that will come down the playfield. The standard implementation is the so called 7-bag random generator, meaning that all seven one-sided tetriminos are drawn, randomly, from a bag, before generating another back.

There are [different randomizers][wiki-tetris-guideline-random-alt].

### Holding zone / Hold piece

The player can press a button to send the falling tetrimino to the hold box, and any tetrimino that had been in the hold box moves to the top of the screen and begins falling.

### Ghost piece

The _ghost piece_ indicates where the _Tetromino_ will land, if it were dropped, It greatly reduces the number of misdrops.

### Rotation

Rotation of a _Tetromino_ is actually not straight-forward. The system and specification that deals with this is called the _Super Rotation System_ (SRS).

![All the four rotation states of all the 7 Tetrominos](../../images/articles/tetris/001-introduction/srs.png "The various rotations when using the SRS.")

In general, when unobstructed, _Tetrominos_ rotate as you would except: about a single point. Because this is purely a mathematical **rotatation** without any **translation**, there are states in which the _J_, _L_, _S_, _T_ and _Z_ _Tetrominos_ "float" above their bounding box.

However, when obstructed, the game will attempt to "kick" the _Tetromino_ into an alternative position nearby. The rules for these are described in [the section about Wall Kicks][wiki-tetris-guideline-rotation].

### Levels

A player levels up by clearing lines (filling them completely), or performing "T-Spins". Higher levels usually have higher drop-speeds and higher score (-multipliers).

### Scoring

The [Guideline scoring system][wiki-tetris-guideline-scoring] dictates that certain _ways_ of clearing a line have different scores than _other ways_. We won't go into the different combos, b2b, spins and so forth right now, but this will come up as we're implementing the game.

## Next steps

No code has be written yet. The next steps are figuring out:

- Which models and concerns are there? This will be accomplished by mapping the various nouns from the definitions and concepts above to programming namespaces and function names.
- What toolchain should we use? This will be determined by _the needs_. That means deciding on a library/framework (if any), and the style of the output.
- What unique gameplay element(s) do we want to implement? The less Tetris-y the better! Gotta be unique.
